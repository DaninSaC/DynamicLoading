# DynamicLoading

Connects you with the worlds you want to play on.
Needs DynamicLoadingServer to work and you should also install the StopServer plugin on all servers you want to automatically stop if nobody is online.

With this plugin on you lobby server you can create signs with the text "[Join]" (upper and lowercase is irrelevent) in the first row and in the second row the name of your server like they are written in your bungee config. If you click on the sign you get teleported to the server if it's online else DynamicLoadingServer will start the server for you automatically (if you have it configured correctly with the paths and names, etc.) and you get connected after the server is online. You can also use the /connect command if you specify the correct server.

The idea of this plugin is, that only the server on which somebody want to play gets started to save ressources for the other server and get them to run smoother.
